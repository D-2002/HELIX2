This is a code repository for the prototype of the “Helix” website that we created.

“Helix”- India’s first meta-drama series aims to develop a complete online model and provide a virtual house environment incorporating the following features:

Users can either be competitors or audience. Users can play with their own profile or play as a CATFISH!!
Users can communicate and get connected to people around the world through groups as well as through private chats.
Features like mini games, tasks and eliminations are included.
After the game is over, the steaming for audience will be available.
This model will provide more drama than any offline reality show ever could! Conceal identities, make strategic interactions, be friends but with hidden intentions, eliminate your competition and manipulate others to believe your version of reality!
